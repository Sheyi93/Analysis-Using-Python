# Analysis-Using-Python
This project is a result of analysis on a dataset to determine if an individual is happy or unhappy.
To do this, we would utilize certain factors including;
  - Availability of information about city services
  - Housing costs
  - Quality of public education
  - Trust in law enforcement
  - Maintenance of infrastructure
  - Access to community services
We would be using the Linear and Quadratic variants of Discriminant Analysis (LDA & QDA) to divide the dataset into Happy or Unhappy (Which are mutually exclusive), based on the factors stated above.
